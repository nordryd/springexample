# springexample
A (hopefully) simple example of Spring to demonstrate the power of Spring Beans and dependency injection.

If the team likes this enough, I can formally write out some documentation to clarify points and give a breakdown of
how to do shit (to the best of my knowledge anyways :P)

Most of the details on how this shit works will be in the compdepinj project (as where that's the ideal setup is 
located).
